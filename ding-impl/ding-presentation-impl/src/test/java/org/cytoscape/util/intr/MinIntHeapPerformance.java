  RESULTS OF RUNNING TESTS ON A COMPUTER.  THESE PERFORMANCE TESTS
  MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPUTING UNIQUE SETS OF INTEGERS FROM
  SETS OF INTEGERS CONTAINING POTENTIAL DUPLICATES, USING 4 DIFFERENT
  ALGORITHMIC STRATEGIES.  THE PROBLEM IS: GIVEN A SET OF N INTEGERS
  IN THE RANGE [0,N-1], RETURN A SUBSET WITH DUPLICATES REMOVED.

  Giving the JVM half a gig of memory, against the same random
  bytes file, under "same conditions".  Note: the set of unique
  integers returned by the heap and tree test is ordered as a result
  of the nature of the algorithm.

           Milliseconds taken to perform test case:

	/**
	 * Argument at index 0: a number representing the number of elements to be
	 * tossed onto a heap.  If N elements are tossed onto a heap, each element
	 * shall be in the range [0, N-1].<p>
	 * Standard input is read, and should contain bytes [read: binary data] of
	 * input defining
	 * integer elements to be tossed onto the heap, with enough
	 * bytes to define N integers (each integer is 4 bytes of standard input).
	 * Integers are
	 * defined from the input by taking groups of 4 consecutive bytes from input,
	 * each group defining a single integer by interpreting the first byte in
	 * a group to be the most significant bits of the integer etc.  The
	 * range [0, N-1] of each integer is satisifed by dividing the positized
	 * value of each assembled
	 * four-byte integer by N, and taking the remainder as the element to be
	 * tossed onto the heap.<p>
	 * Writes to standard out the ordered set of input integers with
	 * duplicates pruned, such that each output integer is followed by the
	 * system's newline separator character sequence.  The integers written are
	 * in plaintext, unlike the format of the input.<p>
	 * Output to standard error is the time taken to use the heap to order
	 * the input, with duplicates removed.  The output format is simply a
	 * plaintext
	 * integer representing the number of milliseconds required for this
	 * test case, followed by the system's newline separator character
	 * sequence.  Basically, a timer starts
	 * right before calling the MinIntHeap constructor with an array of
	 * input integers; the timer stops after we've instantiated a new array to
	 * contain the ordered list of elements with duplicates removed, and after
	 * we've completely filled the array with these elements.  Note that
	 * the process of instantiating this array is time consuming and has nothing
	 * to do with the algorithm we're trying to test; this operation is
	 * included in this time trial anyways.<p>
	 * An optional second argument to this program is the string 'repeat' -
	 * this command-line option will run a first test, and then a repeated test
	 * using the same objects that were used in the first test (basically, the
	 * purpose of the repeated test is to not instantiate anything) - all
	 * output information is based off of the repeated test.
