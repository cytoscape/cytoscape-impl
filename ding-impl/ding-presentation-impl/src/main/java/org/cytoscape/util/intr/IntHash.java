/**
 * An insert-only hashtable that has non-negative 32 bit integer keys;
 * no satellite data is stored in this hashtable.  An instance of this class
 * is well-suited for efficiently detecting collisions between integers,
 * removing duplicates from a list of integers, or determining the presence of
 * an integer in a list of integers.<p>
 * In the underlying implementation, this hashtable increases in size to adapt
 * to elements being added (the underlying size of the hashtable is invisible
 * to the programmer).  In the underlying implementation, this hashtable never
 * decreases in size.  As a hashtable increases in size,
 * it takes at most four times as much memory as it would take
 * to store the hashtable's elements in a perfectly-sized array.
 * Underlying size expansions are implemented such that the operation of
 * expanding in size is amortized over the contstant time complexity of
 * inserting new elements.<p>
 * An instance of this class is serializable; however, serialized instances of
 * this class should not be stored in a persistent manner because the
 * serialization implemented in this class makes no attempt at handling
 * class versioning.
